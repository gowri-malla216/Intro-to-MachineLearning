# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project
This project is my first step into Machine Learning, where I analyze the Titanic dataset, clean the data, and build a Linear Regression model to predict passenger survival probabilities.

## Project Overview
- The goal of this project is to explore, preprocess, and train a predictive model using the Titanic dataset.
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing survival rates across different passenger groups.
  - Model Training: Implementing Linear Regression to predict survival probability.
  - Performance Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy using RMSE and RÂ² Score.

## Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Before training the model, we cleaned and processed the dataset:
  - Filled missing age values using the median
  - Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
  - Normalized numerical features for better model performance
  - Removed irrelevant columns (Name, Ticket, Cabin)
